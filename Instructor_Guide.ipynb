        "The goal of the APEX STATS modules is to teach statistical reasoning and concepts through examples that incorporate Python. The modules expose students to Python gradually and provide low-stakes opportunities for them to modify code to perform analysis. This is a <i>stats-first</i> approach, not a Python-first approach, which means that Python background is not necessary to progress through the content. Rather, students will find themselves growing comfortable with Python as they discover it to be useful for their goals. Similarly, instructors can use APEX STATS modules to teach statistical concepts without needing to emphasize Python. Meanwhile, the Python code is always visible and editable for students and instructors to discover the fun challenge of computer programming.\n",

Therefore, it should be useful for any California community college course in \n",

        "Give your students a link to our prebuilt modules.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Advantages: Most seamless access. No accounts needed. Everybody has the same content. Modules will be updated as bugs are found.\n",
        "* Limitations: If you want to modify the modules in any way, including the snippets and the dataset example, consider the <i>copy and modify</i> strategy, instead. Since all these modules are public, it may be difficult to rely on the existing modules for assessment. Finally, you may prefer a different approach than we took in our modules.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Strategy 2: Copy and modify modules\n",
        "\n",
        "Copy the existing module into your own Collab account, then modify and share with your students using Google Drive or Github. You can use this method to create a version of the module for assessment; simply change the dataset example and remove what you want students to reproduce.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Advantages: You start with a complete module, so you are free to make as many or few changes as you want. You have complete control over module content and code. You can make the module unique to your class. You can change the dataset.\n",
        "* Limitations: You will not benefit from updates to the modules, or you may have to reimplement your modifications if you want to adopt the updated modules.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Strategy 3: Module Construction Kit\n",
        "\n",
        "Build your own module by copying our Module Construction Kit starter module into your own Collab account or Github repo. Select one of the prepared dataset examples. Then, write or link to whatever instructional content you desire and copy and paste APEX STATS code snippets to create a custom module.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Advantages: This offers the best alignment to the specifics of your course and your students. You will have full control over terminology, concepts, and depth of explanation. This approach also allows you to further demphasize or empahize Python. You can make your own updates to your module.\n",
        "* Limitations: It will take time to build and test your modules. Although all code snippets should run without error, you may occasionally encounter unexpected outputs."
