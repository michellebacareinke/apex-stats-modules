        "So far, we have encountered population distributions and sample distributions. Now, we introduce a third kind of distribution, one that is created when we take repeated random samples. This third kind of distribution is called a **sampling distribution**. Yes, sampling distribution sounds very close to sample distribution. They sound so similar, people often confuse them. But, they are different kinds of distributions. Sampling distributions have some interesting properties that are important to understanding inferential statistics. \n",
        "\n",
        "These exercises map onto several learning objective(s) for the C-ID descriptor for [Introduction to Statistics](https://c-id.net/descriptors/final/show/365). Upon successful completion of the course, you will be able to:  \n",

        "(1) Interpret data displayed in tables and graphically  \n",
        "\n",

        "\n",

        "## II. Background Reading\n",
        "\n",
        "Read through this section before starting this module and consider the questions that follow.\n",
        "\n",
        "In order to understand sampling distributions, we will first take a moment to discuss some of the underlying concepts: random sampling, sample size, population size, and sampling error. \n",
        "\n",
        "### Random Sampling\n",
        "\n",
        "Sampling is the process of selecting a group representative of the population. The best way to do this is to use **random sampling with replacement**. To take a random sample with replacement, the following conditions must be satisified:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. All units need to be available for selection. Usually, this means that you would need a list of all units in the population. The list units is called the **sampling frame**.\n",
        "2. The selection is unbiased; each unit has an equal chance of being selected. This is the random part.\n",
        "3. After a unit is selected, it is returned to the list. This is the replacement part; you are replacing the unit you selected by putting it back. This preserves the prior rule; every time selection is done, every unit has an equal chance of being selected.\n",
        "4. The random sample is composed of all the units that were selected in step 2. Therefore, not only does the process of selecting units need to be unbiased, the representation of units in the sample also needs to be unbiased.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Sample Size and Population Size\n",
        "The **size** of a distribution is the number of units it contains. In mathematics, sample size is typically represented as $n$ and population size is typically represented as $N$. In APA-style writing, however, sample size is represented as $N$, and $n$ is used to represent a subsample (a part of a sample, such as the units in one condition). There does not seem to be a recommended symbol for population size in APA style. Why not? Many times, the population size is unknown.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Sampling Error\n",
        "**Sampling error** is a mismatch between a sample statistic and a population parameter. Taking a single random sample does not guarantee perfect representation of a population. In this activity, we will create a population distribution, take a single random sample, and then compare the population and sample distributions. Let's start by focusing on creating and exploring a population distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Discussion Questions\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Imagine you wanted to randomly sample (with replacement) the mood of fans of the winning team at a stadium. Describe one way you could create a sampling frame, a list of all members of a population.\n",
        "2. Describe how you would implement random selection.\n",
        "3. What does it mean to do the selection with replacement?\n",
        "4. Next, imagine you wanted to randomly sample the attitudes of commuters in your city. What are some challenges in creating a sampling frame?\n",
        "5. Imagine you had access to auto registration records for your city and participation from companies who provided lists of commuting employees. How might a sampling frame constructed this way be biased?\n",
        "4. Is there a conflict between informed consent and random sampling?\n",
        "5. Is it possible to determine the size of the following populations? If so, how? If not, why not?\n",

        "    * Adults in the United States\n",
        "    * Dogs living in your city\n",
        "6. APA is a format for statistical results used in Psychology and some other disciplines. If you were reading statistics in APA style, what would this mean? $N$ = 50, $n_1$ = 22, $n_2$ = 28"

Imagine that we want to understand the data for the included countries and only the included countries. If the included countries are the only ones we care about, then we can treat these data as a population. For the purpose of our example, we will treat these data as a population. However, if you wanted to define all countries as your population, the data file is a subset of all countries. Although it can be challenging that these data could either be a population or a sample, it illustrates that populations are defined by researchers.

        "\n",
        "1. We started with a population distribution. The shape of the population distribution is not important (did you notice that all the populations were close to a uniform distribution? None of the populations were normally distributed). While we're at it, the population _size_ is also not important. This example would have worked with a population of 50 or a population of 300,000.\n",
        "2. We took a random sample from the population, with replacement. We found the mean of our random sample. \n",
        "3. We repeated Step 2 many times to create a list of 2000 sample means stored in a variable called `sampling`. This is our sampling distribution. **Sampling distributions are made of sample means**. Put another way, the units of a sampling distribution are sample means.\n",
        "\n",
        "What did you you notice when you look at the histogram of the sampling distribution? It should have been close to normally distributed! We started with a non-normal population and ended up with a normally distributed sampling distribution. This is one of the outcomes specified by the central limit theorem.\n",
        "\n",
        "What did you notice about the difference between the mean of the sampling distribution and the mean of the population? It should have been small. It should have been the smallest value of all the examples in this section. This is another outcome specified by the central limit theorem. As we collect more and more sample means, the mean of the sampling distribution will approach the mean of the population.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why is this useful? The tendency of repeated random samples to perfectly approximate the population they are drawn from says that even if a sample is not perfect (it has sampling error), we can use random samples to estimate population parameters. We also can predict how imperfect our samples are; the larger the sample and the lower the population standard deviation, the better we can rely on our single sample. This means we should be more skeptical when we see smaller sample sizes, samples of very diverse populations, or both.\n",
        "\n",

Well, we typically do not work with the sampling distribution directly. We simply understand that it exists. Creating a sampling distribution requires the population distribution to be available to us, and reearchers often do not have population data available. Further, the central limit theorem specifies taking an _unlimited_ number of samples in order for the sampling distribution mean to equal the population mean. It also requires a sample size of $N\\ge30$ when the population is not normally distributed.
