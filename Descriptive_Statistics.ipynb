        "In this module, we will introduce some of the most fundamental and useful tools for making sense out of distributions of data. We call these **descriptive statistics**, and they are methods of summarizing a distribution of numbers in a single value. Imagine summarizing your performance in college in a single number, your GPA. While your GPA is informative, it is not the whole picture of your college performance. In the same way, we will see that single number summaries give us an informative, but incomplete, summary of data. However, when we examine several descriptive statistics, we are able to gain a much clearer summary of our data.\n",
        "\n",
        "We focus on quantitative distributions in the module, which have three properties that can be summarized. Distributions have **central tendency**, which is the value of the scores. Distributions have **spread** or **variability**, which is how different scores are from other scores in the distribution. Finally, distributions have a **shape** which becomes apaprent when they are graphed using a histogram. \n",

Club is a nominal variable because the values (the club names) are category labels. Because the values are words, it seems obvious that the club is not a quantitative variable. However, this also applies to the jersey number. Even though jerseys are labeled with numbers, they are still nominal variables. Higher jersey numbers do not indicate more of anything. Adding two jersey numbers together does not result in a meaningful number.\n",

Bar graphs are useful summaries, but they do not have a shape like a histogram would. A variation on the bar graph is a **Pareto chart**, which orders the bars from tallest (highest frequency) to smallest (lowest frequency), leaving an equal space between each bar. But even if we follow this convention, the graph is not technically a histogram. That said, it shows frequencies, just like a histogram.\n",
